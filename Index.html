  <div class="about-text">We are no stranger to the darkness and stigma that men fight everday. <br></br>
      We have thought of suicide and that everyone was better off if we were gone.<br></br>
      we have thought that we were all alone... that there was no one who could possibly understand what we were going through. <br></br>
      we didn't want to open up or reach out becase we felt like we were WEAK or a burden.
      <br></br>
      we fell deeper and deeper into the darkness: that men are suppose to be srong, and never break down mentally. <br></br>
      However, through our desire to be better for ourselves and families, <br></br>we used the gym and our bond to make gains in both the gym and our personal lives.
      <br></br>
      The gym helped us break through what we thought were our limits; not only physically but mentally too. <br></br>
      our ability to rely on one another grew as did our mental and physical strength.<br></br>
      We strive everyday to build ourselves and eachother up... in every sense of the word. <br></br> through all of this we developed resiliency and a bond that can not be broken.
      <br></br>
      This is how hopeless gains was created, this is our origin.
