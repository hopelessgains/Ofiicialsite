    The DDD podcast was started after Mike spent several years <br> lost in the dark in regards to raising a child with a medical disorder. <br>He contemplated suicide on a daily basis, <br> became someone he didnâ€™t recognize and almost lost his marriage <br> due to his inability to deal with the emotional traumafrom the diagnosis and all the issues that came from it. <br> The podcast became a way for Mike to find healing for himself, by giving him a purpose.<br> It is also a place for those who feel they have no one else to turn to<br> as they face uncertainty in their lives, and struggle to process their emotions.
